# Abstract

A Byteball Improvement Proposal (BBIP) is a design document providing information to the Byteball community, or describing a new feature for Byteball or its processes or environment. The BBIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend BBIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Byteball. The BBIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the BBIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

# BBIP workflow

The BBIP process begins with a new idea for Byteball. Each potential BBIP must have a champion -- someone who writes the BBIP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The BBIP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is BBIP-able.
Small enhancements or patches to a particular piece of software often don't require standardisation between multiple projects; these don't need a BBIP and should be injected into the relevant project-specific development workflow with a patch submission to the applicable issue tracker.
Additionally, many ideas have been brought forward for changing Byteball that have been rejected for various reasons.
The first step should be to search past discussions to see if an idea has been considered before, and if so, what issues arose in its progression.
After investigating past work, the best way to proceed is by posting about the new idea to the [Byteball Slack](http://slack.byteball.org/).

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a BBIP is meant to save both the potential author and the wider community time.
Asking the Byteball community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do the trick).
It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where Byteball is used.

Once the champion has asked the Byteball community as to whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft BBIP should be presented to the [Byteball Slack](http://slack.byteball.org/).
This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft BBIP to make it properly formatted, of high quality, and to address additional concerns about the proposal.
Following a discussion, the proposal should be submitted to the [BBIPs git repository](https://github.com/byteball/BBIPs) as a pull request.
This draft must be written in BBIP style as described below, and named with an alias such as "bbip-johndoe-infinitebytes" until the editor has assigned it a BBIP number (authors MUST NOT self-assign BBIP numbers).

BBIP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on both the initial idea and the BBIP before submitting it for review. However, wherever possible, long open-ended discussions should be avoided. Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include: setting up a separate Slack channel for the topic, having the BBIP author accept private comments in the early design phases, setting up a wiki page or git repository, etc. BBIP authors should use their discretion here.

It is highly recommended that a single BBIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the BBIP, the more successful it tends to be. If in doubt, split your BBIP into several well-focused ones.

When the BBIP draft is complete, the BBIP editor will assign the BBIP a number, label it as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, and merge the pull request to the BBIPs git repository.
The BBIP editor will not unreasonably reject a BBIP.
Reasons for rejecting BBIPs include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the Byteball philosophy.
For a BBIP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria.
It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement.
The enhancement must represent a net improvement.
The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.

The BBIP author may update the draft as necessary in the git repository. Updates to drafts should also be submitted by the author as pull requests.

## Transferring BBIP Ownership

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BBIPs to a new champion. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred BBIP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the BBIP process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the BBIP. We try to build consensus around a BBIP, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing BBIP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a BBIP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the BBIP editor. If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the BBIP editor will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).

## BBIP Editors

The current BBIP editor is Tony Churyumoff who can be contacted at [Byteball Slack](http://slack.byteball.org/) @tonych.

## BBIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow

The BBIP editor subscribes to the Byteball Slack.

For each new BBIP that comes in an editor does the following:

* Read the BBIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be accepted.
* The title should accurately describe the content.
* The BBIP draft must have been sent to the Byteball Slack for discussion.
* Motivation and backward compatibility (when applicable) must be addressed.
* The defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given specification.
* Licensing terms must be acceptable for BBIPs.

If the BBIP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the BBIP is ready for the repository it should be submitted as a "pull request" to the [BBIPs git repository](https://github.com/byteball/BBIPs) where it may get further feedback.

The BBIP editor will:

* Assign a BBIP number in the pull request.

* Merge the pull request when it is ready.

* List the BBIP in [README.md](README.md)

The BBIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The BBIP editors monitor BBIP changes, and update BBIP headers as appropriate.

# BBIP format and structure

## Specification

BBIPs should be written in Markdown format.

Each BBIP should have the following parts:

* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BBIP ([see below](#bbip-header-preamble)).

* Abstract -- A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

* Copyright -- The BBIP must be explicitly licensed under acceptable copyright terms ([see below](#bbip-licensing)).

* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BBIPs that want to change the Byteball protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol is inadequate to address the problem that the BBIP solves.

* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Byteball platforms.

* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

* Backwards compatibility -- All BBIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The BBIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.

* Reference implementation -- The reference implementation must be completed before any BBIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the BBIP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code. The final implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the Byteball protocol.

### BBIP header preamble

Each BBIP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "*" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

```
  BBIP: <BBIP number, or "?" before being assigned>
  Title: <BBIP title; maximum 44 characters>
  Author: <list of authors' real names and email address or Byteball Slack handle>
* Discussions-To: <email address or url>
* Comments-Summary: <summary tone>
  Comments-URI: <links to wiki page for comments>
  Status: <Draft | Active | Proposed | Deferred | Rejected |
           Withdrawn | Final | Replaced | Obsolete>
  Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
  Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
  License: <abbreviation for approved license(s)>
* License-Code: <abbreviation for code under different approved license(s)>
* Post-History: <dates of postings to Byteball Slack, or link to thread in Slack archive>
* Requires: <BBIP number(s)>
* Replaces: <BBIP number>
* Superseded-By: <BBIP number>
```

The Author header lists the names and email addresses or Slack handles of all the authors/owners of the BBIP.
The format of the Author header value with email address must be

  `Random J. User <address@dom.ain>`

or with a Byteball Slack handle

  `Random J. User @randomjuser`

or

  `Random J. User`

if the address or Slack handle is not given. If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.

While a BBIP is in private discussions (usually during the initial Draft phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list or URL where the BBIP is being discussed. No Discussions-To header is necessary if the BBIP is being discussed privately with the author, or on the Byteball Slack.

The Type header specifies the type of BBIP: Standards Track, Informational, or Process.

The Created header records the date that the BBIP was assigned a number, while Post-History is used to record when new versions of the BBIP are posted to Byteball Slack.
Dates should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.
Post-History is permitted to be a link to a specific thread in a Slack archive.

BBIPs may have a Requires header, indicating the BBIP numbers that this BBIP depends on.

BBIPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a BBIP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the BBIP that replaces the current document. The newer BBIP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the BBIP that it rendered obsolete.

### Auxiliary Files

BBIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Auxiliary files should be included in a subdirectory for that BBIP, or must be named BBIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where "XXXX" is the BBIP number, "Y" is a serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. "png").

# BBIP types

There are three kinds of BBIP:

* A Standards Track BBIP describes any change that affects most or all Byteball implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in transaction validity rules, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Byteball. Standards Track BBIPs consist of two parts, a design document and a reference implementation.
* An Informational BBIP describes a Byteball design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Byteball community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational BBIPs do not necessarily represent a Byteball community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational BBIPs or follow their advice.
* A Process BBIP describes a process surrounding Byteball, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process BBIPs are like Standards Track BBIPs but apply to areas other than the Byteball protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Byteball's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational BBIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Byteball development. Any meta-BBIP is also considered a Process BBIP.

# BBIP status field

## Specification

The typical paths of the status of BBIPs are as follows:

![process](bbip-0001/process.png)

Champions of a BBIP may decide on their own to change the status between Draft, Deferred, or Withdrawn.
The BBIP editor may also change the status to Deferred when no progress is being made on the BBIP.

A BBIP may only change status from Draft (or Rejected) to Proposed, when the author deems it is complete, has a working implementation (where applicable), and has community plans to progress it to the Final status.

BBIPs should be changed from Draft or Proposed status, to Rejected status, upon request by any person, if they have not made progress in three years. Such a BBIP may be changed to Draft status if the champion provides revisions that meaningfully address public criticism of the proposal, or to Proposed status if it meets the criteria required as described in the previous paragraph.

A Proposed BBIP may progress to Final only when specific criteria reflecting real-world adoption has occurred. This is different for each BBIP depending on the nature of its proposed changes. Evaluation of this status change should be objectively verifiable, and/or be discussed on the Byteball Slack.

When a Final BBIP is no longer relevant, its status may be changed to Replaced or Obsolete (which is equivalent to Replaced). This change must also be objectively verifiable and/or discussed.

A process BBIP may change status from Draft to Active when it achieves rough consensus on the Byteball Slack. Such a proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the Byteball Slack for at least one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be given in such circumstances.

Software authors are encouraged to publish summaries of what BBIPs their software supports to aid in verification of status changes.

## Rationale

Why is this necessary at all?

* To give objective criteria to judge the progression of BBIPs, this proposal aims to help keep the Status accurate and up-to-date.

* The BBIP process does not aim to be a kind of forceful "governance" of Byteball, merely to provide a collaborative repository for proposing and providing information on standards, which people may voluntarily adopt or not. It can only hope to achieve accuracy in regard to the "Status" field by striving to reflect the reality of *how things actually are*, rather than *how they should be*.

What if a BBIP is proposed that only makes sense for a single specific project?

* The BBIP process exists for standardisation between independent projects. If something only affects one project, it should be done through that project's own internal processes, and never be proposed as a BBIP in the first place.

# BBIP comments

## Specification

Each BBIP should, in its preamble, link to a public wiki page with a summary tone of the comments on that page.
Reviewers of the BBIP who consider themselves qualified, should post their own comments on this wiki page.
The comments page should generally only be used to post final comments for a completed BBIP.
If a BBIP is not yet completed, reviewers should instead post on the applicable development Slack channel to allow the BBIP author(s) to address any concerns or problems pointed out by the review.

Some BBIPs receive exposure outside the development community prior to completion, and other BBIPs might not be completed at all. To avoid a situation where critical BBIP reviews may go unnoticed during this period, reviewers may, at their option, still post their review on the comments page, provided they first post it to the Byteball Slack and plan to later remove or revise it as applicable based on the completed version. Such revisions should be made by editing the previous review and updating the timestamp. Reviews made prior to the complete version may be removed if they are no longer applicable and have not been updated in a timely manner (eg, within one month).

Pages must be named after the full BBIP number (eg, "BBIP 0001") and placed in the "Comments" namespace.
For example, the link for BBIP 1 will be https://github.com/byteball/BBIPs/wiki/Comments:BBIP-0001 .

Comments posted to this wiki should use the following format:

    <Your opinion> --<Your name>, <Date of posting, as YYYY-MM-DD>

BBIPs may also choose to list a second forum for BBIP comments, in addition to the BBIPs wiki.
In this case, the second forum's URI should be listed below the primary wiki's URI.

After some time, the BBIP itself may be updated with a summary tone of the comments.
Summary tones may be chosen from the following, but this BBIP does not intend to cover all possible nuances and other summaries may be used as needed:

* No comments yet.
* Unanimously Recommended for implementation
* Unanimously Discourage for implementation
* Mostly Recommended for implementation, with some Discouragement
* Mostly Discouraged for implementation, with some Recommendation

For example, the preamble to BBIP 1 might be updated to include the line:

    Comments-Summary: No comments yet.
    Comments-URI: https://github.com/byteball/BBIPs/wiki/Comments:BBIP-0001
                  https://some-other-wiki.org/BBIP_1_Comments

These fields must follow the "Discussions-To" header (if that header is not present, it should follow the position where it would be present; generally this is immediately above the Status header).

To avoid doubt: comments and status are unrelated metrics to judge a BBIP, and neither should be directly influencing the other.

## Rationale

What is the purpose of BBIP comments?

* Various BBIPs have been adopted (the criteria required for "Final" Status) despite being considered generally inadvisable. Some presently regard BBIPs as a "good idea" simply by virtue of them being assigned a BBIP number. Due to the low barrier of entry for submission of new BBIPs, it seems advisable for a way for reviewers to express their opinions on them in a way that is consumable to the public without needing to review the entire development discussion.

Will BBIP comments be censored or limited to particular participants/"experts"?

* Participants should freely refrain from commenting outside of their area of knowledge or expertise. However, comments should not be censored, and participation should be open to the public.

# BBIP licensing

## Specification

New BBIPs may be accepted with the following licenses. Each new BBIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. The License header in the preamble must be placed after the Created header. Each license must be referenced by their respective abbreviation given below.

For example, a preamble might include the following License header:

    License: BSD-2-Clause
             GNU-All-Permissive

In this case, the BBIP text is fully licensed under both the OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license as well as the GNU All-Permissive License, and anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they comply with the terms of *either* license. In other words, the license list is an "OR choice", not an "AND also" requirement.

It is also possible to license source code differently from the BBIP text. A optional License-Code header is placed after the License header. Again, each license must be referenced by their respective abbreviation given below.

For example, a preamble specifying the optional License-Code header might look like:

    License: BSD-2-Clause
             GNU-All-Permissive
    License-Code: GPL-2.0+

In this case, the code in the BBIP is not available under the BSD or All-Permissive licenses, but only under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or newer.
If the code were to be available under *only* version 2 exactly, the "+" symbol should be removed from the license abbreviation.
For a later version (eg, GPL 3.0), you would increase the version number (and retain or remove the "+" depending on intent).

    License-Code: GPL-2.0   # This refers to GPL v2.0 *only*, no later license versions are acceptable.
    License-Code: GPL-2.0+  # This refers to GPL v2.0 *or later*.
    License-Code: GPL-3.0   # This refers to GPL v3.0 *only*, no later license versions are acceptable.
    License-Code: GPL-3.0+  # This refers to GPL v3.0 *or later*.

In the event that the licensing for the text or code is too complicated to express with a simple list of alternatives, the list should instead be replaced with the single term "Complex". In all cases, details of the licensing terms must be provided in the Copyright section of the BBIP.

BBIPs are not required to be *exclusively* licensed under approved terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable licenses *in addition to* at least one acceptable license.
In this case, only the acceptable license(s) should be listed in the License and License-Code headers.

### Recommended licenses

* BSD-2-Clause: [https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license]
* BSD-3-Clause: [https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause OSI-approved BSD 3-clause license]
* CC0-1.0: [https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal]
* GNU-All-Permissive: [http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html GNU All-Permissive License]

In addition, it is recommended that literal code included in the BBIP be dual-licensed under the same license terms as the project it modifies. For example, literal code intended for Byteball Core would ideally be dual-licensed under the MIT license terms as well as one of the above with the rest of the BBIP text.

### Not recommended, but acceptable licenses

* Apache-2.0: [Apache License, version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
* BSL-1.0: [Boost Software License, version 1.0](http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)

* LGPL-2.1+: [GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 2.1 or newer](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html)

### Not acceptable licenses

All licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not acceptable terms for a Byteball Improvement Proposal unless a later BBIP extends this one to add them.
However, BBIPs predating the acceptance of this BBIP were allowed under other terms, and should use these abbreviation when no other license is granted:

* OPL: [Open Publication License, version 1.0](http://opencontent.org/openpub/)
* PD: Released into the public domain

## Rationale

Why is Open Publication License or releasing into the public domain insufficient for BBIPs?

* The OPL is generally regarded as obsolete, and not a license suitable for new publications.
* Many are unfamiliar with the OPL terms, and may just prefer to use the public domain rather than license under uncertain terms.
* The OPL license terms allowed for the author to prevent publication and derived works, which was widely considered inappropriate for Byteball standards.
* Public domain is not universally recognised as a legitimate action, thus it is inadvisable.

Why are there software licenses included?

* Some BBIPs, especially consensus layer, may include literal code in the BBIP itself which may not be available under the exact license terms of the BBIP.
* Despite this, not all software licenses would be acceptable for content included in BBIPs.

Why is Public Domain not acceptable for BBIPs?

* In some jurisdictions, public domain is not recognised as a legitimate legal action, leaving the BBIP simply copyrighted with no redistribution or modification allowed at all.
